# Experiment Index

This file has a lightweight index of all the experiments I'm running so you can go to the file if necessary.

[bold-banana](bold-banana.md): Default swin-v2-base on iNat21

[fuzzy-fig](fuzzy-fig.md): Default swin-v2-base on iNat21 with 1/4 LR

[outrageous-orange](outrageous-orange.md): Hierarchical swin-v2-base on iNat21

[sweet-strawberry](sweet-strawberry.md): Hierarchical swin-v2-base on iNat21 with 1/2 LR

[groovy-grape](groovy-grape.md): Hierarchical swin-v2-base on iNat21 with 1/4 LR

[awesome-apple](awesome-apple.md): Hierarchical swin-v2-base on iNat21 with 5e-5 (1/10 default) LR

[crazy-cranberry](crazy-cranberry.md): swin-v2-base with ImageNet1K pre-trained weights (right now just being to double check that my swin-v2 object detection implementation is correct).

[blazing-blackbery](blazing-blackberry.md): swin-v1-base with ImageNet1K pre-trained weights (being used as a reference point for ImageNet1K applied to Fishnet object detection).
